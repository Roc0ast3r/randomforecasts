So, this is kind of awkward. I've never actually used GitHub before this. Oh, you see a "Roc0ast3rGDPS" project? Pretty sure that was auto-created, cause I DO NOT remember creating that.

Now, I apologize for my crappy coding formatting, I just like extra stuff to make some other stuff simpler (at least to me). I'm that type of guy that wanted 5th grade homework in 2nd grade. This bot was originally created as a Twitter bot using CBDQ, but I have since decided to branch off and add it into GitHub, as I know way more people use GitHub, and could possibly help me be more concise with my coding.

I am also coding another website labelled Comedy Web, but it won't be on GitHub as it is essentially a secret right now. Once I fully finish it and release it to the public, I'll slap it onto GitHub. I actually have way more bots like this, such as DateGenerator. And if you recognize my same somewhere, I'm the guy that made that F All YouTubers bot, which has since been deactivated for own mental capacity, as it was too much work to manage. I kept this one and DateGenerator up because they are both automatic and randomly generated, so all I have to do is add different values to the code and I'll be all good!

If you want more in-depth explanation on everything, please go to the [wiki](https://github.com/Roc0ast3r/randomforecasts/wiki)!

# How does this work?
It's going to be too much to explain it on here, so I advise you to view the wiki for it, which I'm stil working on, as there is a lot to cover about on the wiki. I do have some plans to remake the bot, so keep on the lookout for that!
